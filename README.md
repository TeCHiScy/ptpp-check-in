# ptpp-check-in
Modified version of dabai's ptpp plugin. Functions that were broken, useless or covered in ptpp core are removed, including: calendar, cookie downloading, etc.. Functions like `check_in` and `bars` are reserved and optimized.

# Usage
1. Put `rank.js` and `html2canvas.min.js` into js folder.
2. Modify `index.html`, add `<script src=/js/html2canvas.min.js></script><script src=/js/rank.js></script>` before `</body></html>`.
